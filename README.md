# Flash Card game using Python
It shows the front and back of the card. After 3 seconds It shows the translaotion to the word
After clicking the tick mark it is going to take the flash card in the list so it doesn't show me the word which i already know 
If i click on cross it might come up again
I used tkinter module for GUI
I used pandas for csv file to store the words
